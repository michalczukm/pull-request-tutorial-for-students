# Pull Request Tutorial

## What is a Pull Request?
From Github's [Using Pull Requests Page](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

Pull Requests are commonly used by teams and organizations collaborating using the [Shared Repository Model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#article-platform-nav), where everyone shares a single repository and topic branches are used to develop features and isolate changes. Many open source projects on Github use pull requests to manage changes from contributors as they are useful in providing a way to notify project maintainers about changes one has made and in initiating code review and general discussion about a set of changes before being merged into the main branch.

Here's [an example pull request](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1051) from jQuery's github repo.

## Creating a Pull Request

There are 2 main work flows when dealing with pull requests:

1. Pull Request from a branch within a repository
1. ~~Pull Request from a [forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)~~ (this article is not about this flow)

Here we are going to focus on 1.

### Creating a Topical Branch

First, we will need to create a branch **from the latest commit** on master (or `develop`, depends on git flow you're using). 

Make sure your repository is up to date first using

```bash
git pull origin master
```

*Note:* `git pull` does a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge` to update the local repo with the remote repo. For a more detailed explanation, see [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/whats-the-difference-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch).

To create a branch, use `git checkout -b <new-branch-name> [<base-branch-name>]`, where `base-branch-name` is optional and defaults to `master`. I'm going to create a new branch called `pull-request-demo` from the `master` branch and push it to github.

```bash
git checkout -b pull-request-demo
git push origin pull-request-demo
```

### Creating a Pull Request

To create a pull request, you must have changes committed to your new branch.

Go to the repository page on github. And click on "Pull Request" button in the repo header.

![Pull Request Button](./assets/create-pr-1.png)

Select branches:

* Select the **base** branch (it is your **target** branch), where you want to merge your changes to.
* Select **compare** branch, your branch which you'd like to merge

![Select branches](./assets/create-pr-2.png)

Enter meaningful **title** and **description** for your pull request (other people will be reading this, not machines!).

Remember you can use [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) in the description and comments.

![Title and Description](./assets/create-pr-3.png)

Finally, click on the green "Create pull request" button to finish creating the pull request.

You should now see an open pull request.

Which might be ready for merge (doesn't make sense, without code review :exclamation: No way :exclamation:) - depending on your GitHub repository settings.

Or with constraints, like `Review reqired` (thats how we do it :blush:)

### Using a Pull Request

So, you received a PR. What next :question:


* View all the commits by all contained by a pull request under the commits tab,
![Commits tab](./assets/using-pr-1.png)
* See all file changed, and make inline comments there (recommended). You
![Files Changed](./assets/using-pr-2.png)
* Review changes/Finish review
![Review changes](./assets/using-pr-3.png)
After that üëá

### Updating a Pull Request

:wave: you, PR creator, yes you :exclamation:

Since pull request is a request to add commit from one stream (branch) to another, the simplest way to update code in your PR is to ... push new commits on your branch.

```bash
# add changes, improvements, make your PR better
...

# then commit it
git commit -m "meaningful message describing your changes"

# and push it
git push origin pull-request-demo
```

### Merging a Pull Request

Once you and your collaborators are happy with the changes, you start to merge the changes back to master. There are a few ways to do this.

First, you can use github's "Merge pull request" button at the bottom of your pull request to merge your changes. This is only available when github can detect that there will be **no merge conflicts** with the base branch. If all goes well, you just have to add a commit message and click on "Confirm Merge" to merge the changes.

![merge pull request button](./assets/merge-1.png)

Then confirm it

![confirm Merge](./assets/merge-2.png)

And done :clap: :clap: :clap:

![merged](./assets/merge-3.png)

You can now remove your branch from GitHub. You probably won't gonna need it since all its changes got **merged** into `master`.

#### Squash, Rebase, and Cherry Pick

In long standing branches, merging can often cause lots problems when updating if changes in a given branch conflict with changes recently merged into the master branch. If there are many commits to the same file, `git merge` may force you to fix the same merge conflicts over and over again, causing a real headache. While there are many ways to mitigate this issue, such as enabling [`git rerere`](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rerere.html) to reuse recorded resolution of conflict merges, squashing a series of related changes into 1 commit and cherry-picking it into the master is a great solution, especially for topic branches and isolated features.

There are several advantages of performing merges this way. First, you only have to deal with merge conflicts once, since all commits are compressed into 1. Second, each commit represents an entire set of changes required for a feature or task, which makes it easy to pin point bugs and other problems when they arise and to remove a change set when it's no longer necessary.

There are also disadvantages of squashing commits. First, you will lose the details and information for each change, as all changes squashed are compressed together. So the net effect is the same. Second, it can be dangerous and problematic if used incorrectly, such as squashing commits that have been pushed to the remote server **and** others depend on for their work. Because squashing is changing the git history, you can cause many conflicts that way. However, if you are using this locally or you are the only person working on your branch and you know exactly what you are doing.

To perform this, use the following command

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~10
```

`-i` stands for [interactive mode](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) and `HEAD~10` means to examine the 10 latest commits.

If you see an `fatal: Needed a single revision` error, this usually means that there are not that many commits left. Try a lower number.

This will open up an editor with git commit messages that looks something like this:

![Git Rebase](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/676185/317107/cdcd54d6-9858-11e2-9e78-7642fa363f10.png)

There are many options available at this stage. These are detailed in [this github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Here, I'm going to simply squash all changes in this pull request into one. Save and close the editor.

![Squashing commits](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/676185/317112/21e1a702-9859-11e2-8c03-7f344002768e.png)

The next screen will pop up asking you to edit your commit messages. You can choose to edit them or simply continue. Save and close the editor.

Once your squash completes, you can push it to the remote repo. In this case, these squashed commits have been pushed to the server. However, I'm the only user of this branch and can safely force push the commit to update the git repo.

```bash
git push origin pull-request-demo -f
```

To merge the commit, we will use [`git cherry-pick`](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cherry-pick.html).

You are done! Github should detect the changes and update the pull request. You can then marked the pull request as merged and optionally delete the branch.

### Closing a Pull Request

You can always close PR.

#### Why?

* it was created by mistake
* it is totally not ready for review
* it is :suspect: and you don't want it in your repo
* ... whatever reason is good for closing it

:warning: If it is **your teammate** PR, you should probably contact with him/her and discuss that to avoid misunderstandings.

In general - be verbose, be good communicator, ask :blush:

#### How?
